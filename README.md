# raspi-picture-frame

See [here](https://jreyesr.github.io/raspi-picture-frame/) for a more detailed description.

A writeup of the process to hack an old Kodak picture frame to become
the screen of a Raspberry Pi.

No adapters, daughter boards or extra chips used. Done purely by the power
of DPI and ~some~ a lot of soldering.

This may also serve as a guide to anyone wishing to drive a TFT LCD manually,
or to anyone wishing to use the A080SN01 display, specifically.
