## Introduction

Recently I decided to try and give some use to an old picture frame that we've had laying around for a very long time.
It's a Kodak EasyShare _something something_ picture frame which has no model number that I could find, and a sticker on the back 
that says _Manufacture date: 2010_. 

// TODO: Picture?

It is similar to [this SV-811 model](https://www.amazon.ca/Kodak-SV-811-DIGITAL-PICTURE-FRAME/dp/B000MURAU6)
but it's not exactly the same, it has a 800x600 LCD screen and it was _never_ used.

Naturally, an LCD screen of that size would be an awesome thing to have. Plus, I get to tinker with fast digital signals without using
an oscilloscope!
